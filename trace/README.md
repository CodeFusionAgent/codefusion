# Tracing, Datasets and Evaluations

This directory handles execution traces, datasets, and evaluation metrics for CodeFusion exploration sessions.

## Structure

- **exploration_logs/**: Detailed logs from agentic exploration sessions
- **llm_traces/**: LLM interaction traces and monitoring data  
- **datasets/**: Code datasets for training and evaluation
- **evals/**: Evaluation metrics and benchmarking results
- **performance/**: Performance and timing data

## Usage

Traces are automatically generated during exploration sessions and can be used for:

- Debugging exploration strategies
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Understanding agent behavior patterns
- Reproducing exploration results
- Evaluation and benchmarking

## File Formats

- **JSON**: Structured data for programmatic analysis
- **Log files**: Human-readable exploration traces
- **CSV**: Metrics and evaluation data
